## About

Wicked Havens is a game inspired by 2000 _Nival Interactive_'s game _Evil Islands_ "Curse of the Lost Soul". As metroidvania's were inspired by metroid and many games used the diablo genre, Wicked Havens is a strategic ARPG with stealth, magic and crafting elements.

Wicked havens is by no mean the definitive name, but is used heavily in production.

Please note we do not own any right on _Evil Islands_ and Nival Interactive retains all their Trademark, Content and copyrights.
